**Describe the bug**
You can skip watching ads on YouTube through a loophole in the browser, and this can be done when the ad appears.


**To Reproduce**
All you have to do is watch YouTube using the browser, and when the ad appears, just click the About Ad button, then click the Block Ad and continue. In the end, the ad will disappear without you having to watch it all, and when any ad appears again, repeat the process.

**Expected behavior**
In the YouTube application on phones, you can block the ad, but you are still forced to watch it until the end. I think this is what should also happen to browsers.

**Additional context**
I think this is a useful bug more than it is a harmful bug for some players
