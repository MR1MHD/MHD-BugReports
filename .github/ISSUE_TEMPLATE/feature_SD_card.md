**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
 A while ago, I was going to store some photos on a memory card using my laptop, but I did not find a connection that would allow me to put the card inside the laptop, so I had to use a complicated and long method to do that.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I wish the devices had come with a slot that would allow the memory card to be inserted without the need for a connector.


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
I transferred the files to the phone first, then from the phone to the memory card
