**Describe the bug**
In a Boom Beach game, there is a gap in the storage capacity of materials such as iron, stones, gold, and wood.
 There is a person called trade who comes every once in a while and brings with her some valuable barter. When the store of a certain item is full, it is still possible to barter and get more. Even if the store is full, bartering can always get more.

**To Reproduce**
When the store of a certain item is full, it is still possible to barter and get more. Even if the store is full, bartering can always get more.

**Expected behavior**
It is normal in any game, when the maximum storage limit is reached, to give a warning signal to the player that the storage is full or to reject the trading process that leads to the storage being filled with an amount more than it can handle.
