**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
Sometimes, people forget to change the oil or water in the car (I am not talking about the lack of water or oil). I mean the regular maintenance required for the car. Why is there not a special program that you can put the carâ€™s information on and that will prepare a special reminder schedule to remind you to do it? With necessary maintenance.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
I wish there was a program or application approved by well-known car companies in order to rely on it to carry out the necessary periodic maintenance of the car.


**Describe alternatives you've considered**
In the normal situation, each person must write down and record the last time he performed periodic maintenance manually, and this makes it unlikely that errors or forgetting something will occur.
